## Project Overview
This app allows users to switch between three visually and structurally distinct themes:
- Theme 1 (Default): Minimalist, light background with simple sans-serif fonts.

- Theme 2: Dark mode featuring a sidebar navigation layout with bold serif fonts.

- Theme 3: Colorful, card-based grid layout with a playful Google Font (Pacifico).

The app's main content area fetches and displays products dynamically from fakestoreapi.com. The theme selection persists across page reloads using localStorage and React Context API for state management.

- Dynamic data fetching from a public API with product listing

- React Router powered multi-page support (Home, About, Contact)

- Accessible and semantic HTML structure

- Developed using modern TypeScript and React practices

- Icons via Tabler Icons React component library

- Tailwind CSS for utility-first styling
